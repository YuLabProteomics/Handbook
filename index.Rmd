# Welcome!

Welcome to the Yu Lab Handbook. Developed by [Qing Yu](https://www.yu-research.org/), this handbook introduces the Yu Lab to prospective members, familiarizes current members with the lab environment, and outlines key guidelines for fostering an inclusive, collaborative space. Our goal is to make your research experience in the lab both productive and enjoyable.
